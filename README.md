# My-First-Project
In my first project i have used Front end and made GYM interface which consist of navigation bar along with small form of different input types like password, numbers, email and buttons where the user can use to register themselves or login.
Since i have used only front-end so the actual submissio  of form will not be possible but its quite enough for me since it was my first project of my journey towards Web Development.
